	<h1>Royal College of Art First Ever Sustainability Report </h1>

	<div class="container">
		<div class="item a">
			<p>In 2020, The Royal College of Art, the world’s leading arts university, placing number one in the QS World Universities rankings<sup><a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2020/art-design" target="_blank">1</a></sup> still doesn’t publish an annual sustainability report. Yet there seems to be a large interest in the issue within the student body.</p><br>

			<p>We’ve decided to take it upon ourselves and create the first-ever Sustainability report of the Royal College of Art, it presents the organisation's values and governance model and its commitment to a sustainable global economy. Our investigation into RCA’s sustainability procedures brings awareness and transparency to the university’s state of unforthcoming affairs. In February 2020, a letter<sup><a href="img/letter.jpg" target="_blank">2</a></sup> was sent to the vice-chancellor Paul Thompson’s office inviting him to the exhibition (Eco)logical sense where the report was to be exhibited for the first time, the invitation was subsequently declined<sup><a href="img/emailreply.pdf" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.</p>
